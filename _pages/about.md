I am a Physics PhD student in [Ekuma Group](https://cekumagroup.cas.lehigh.edu), Department of Physics, Lehigh University. My research revolves around the computational design and high-throughput investigations of new materials for applications in next-generation devices and technologies. ⛅

I study the physics of low-dimensional solid-state systems such as 2D materials, their interfaces and heterostructures (e.g: transition metal dichalcogenides, group-IV monochalcogenides, Pb-free perovskites, etc). Using state-of-the-art electronic structure codes I perform computations at the level of Density Functional and Many-body perturbation theory, and study various physical properties including electronics, optoelectronics, energetic and mechanical structures, topology, etc. In pursuit of innovative materials design and efficient analysis, I also harness the power of data-driven machine learning for high-throughput design of new materials.
