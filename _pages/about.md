I am a PhD student at the Department of Physics, Lehigh University working in the realm of computational design and high-throughput investigation of new materials for applications in next-generation technologies under the supervision of [Dr. Chinedu Ekuma](https://cekumagroup.cas.lehigh.edu). 

My research deals with the study of two-dimensional layered solid-state systems, specifically transition metal chalcogenides and perovskites, and is centered around the computational modeling of the electronic and optical properties of these systems, utilizing cutting-edge techniques such as first-principles density functional theory and many-body approximations like GW-BSE. In pursuit of innovative materials design and efficient analysis, I also harness the power of data-driven machine learning for high-throughput exploration.
